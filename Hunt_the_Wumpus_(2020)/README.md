# Hunt the Wumpus

In May 2020, I installed a python IDE, obtained a copy of John Zelle's _Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science_, and worked through the process of learning the language. Alongside the lessons of the book, I was able to explore the versatility of python by creating programs I was interested in, and I soon directed most of that energy to one large project.

Over the course of that summer, I constructed Hunt the Wumpus, an arcade-style dungeon exploration game very losely based on the text-based game of the same name by 	Gregory Yob. Using the <a href="https://www.pygame.org">pygame</a> library, I designed and implemented every aspect of the gameplay mechanics, visuals, and interface essentially from scratch. While there are many shortcomings of the final product from a design standpoint, it still functions well as playable game.

NOTE: The core file (Wumpus2.py) does require the pygame library to be installed for graphics and user input. Also note that due to an update in the library, some items (e.g. rounded rectangles) will not display properly.
