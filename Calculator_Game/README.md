# Calculator Game

This is less of a project and more of a bit of recreational mathematics that has occupied my mind for years. It is essentially a kind of cellular automata, a process I devised when bored in middle school and which I would carry out on a scientific calculator. I don't suspect it has much academic merit, but it exhibits some similarities to chaotic behavior, and I've still found myself idly iterating through it in an effort to see what else I can figure out about what it does.
