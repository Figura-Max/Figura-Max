# Beam Deflection in Hollow Profiles

In the spring of 2024, I was enrolled in the course MAT455: Numerical Mathematics and Computation at Augsburg University, in which we learned about, implemented, and tested many such computational methods for solving mathematical problems. One large project in the course involved implementing a program for Gaussian elimination on pentadiagonal matrices, then using that to solve a model of a linear beam deflecting under perpendicular force. Each given two cross-sectional profiles and two affixion schemes to test, we were charged to write a short paper and orally present our findings in class.

All code was written in GNU Octave, with the pentadiagonal solver adapted from _Numerical Mathematics and Computing_ by Cheney and Kincaid and the mathematical background supplied by instructor Pavel Bělík.
