# Image Composite
This is a rather simple project, technically speaking, but it is one of the first cases in which I was able to use my programming skills to realise an idea. The goal was to create a "time lapse" in a single image, such that a positional displacement in the picture corresponds to a temporal displacement in its capture. I was able to utilise a Python image-manipulation library and create a program to composite a number of frames together in the manner, with the frames first having been extracted from the video using FFmpeg. In retrospect, there are a number of shortcomings with the program, and I may someday rewrite it to improve functionality and usability, but it nonetheless served my purposes and produced satisfying results.
