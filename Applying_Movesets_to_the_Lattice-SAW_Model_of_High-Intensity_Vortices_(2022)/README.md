# Applying Movesets to the Lattice-SAW Model of High-Intensity Vortices
In the summer of 2022, I was fortunate to be accepted into Augsburg University's Undergraduate Research and Graduate Opportunity (URGO) program, spending ten weeks doing research with Dr. Pavel Bělík. The subject was a continuation of one of Dr. Bělík's projects, which concerned the modeling of vortices using a self-avoiding walk (SAW) constrained to a lattice grid. The focus was on applying a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) process that would transform the model from one state to determine properties of the system as a whole.

Over the course of the ten weeks, I implemented the basic model using Julia, incorporated a variety of movesets for transforming the SAW, ran many simulations, and equipped a "simulated annealing" algorithm to find and study minimum-energy configurations of the system. In addition to the body of code which I wrote, I compiled my work into a paper, presented it orally, and created a poster for Augsburg's March 2023 Zyzzogeton event.
