# A Computational Exploration of the Chaotic Lorenz System

In the spring of 2024, I was enrolled in the course MAT455: Numerical Mathematics and Computation at Augsburg University, in which we learned about, implemented, and tested many such computational methods for solving mathematical problems. For the final project, we were tasked to apply a suite of methods to an ordinary differential equation problem, producing a short paper and presenting our work in class.

I used the project to briefly explore the Lorenz attractor, observing both the behavior of the system itself and the performance of our various ODE methods upon it. All code was written in GNU Octave, with the various methods (all code files other than Lorenz.m) having been adapted directly from _Numerical Mathematics and Computing_ by Cheney and Kincaid, as well as materials provided by instructor Pavel Bělík.
