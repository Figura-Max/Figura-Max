# Hello! I'm Max Figura
I am currently an undergraduate Mathematics and Computer Science double major at Augsburg University.

I have worked extensively in Python, Java, Julia, and GNU Octave, with some limited experience in C, C++, and R. I also use LaTeX and HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and I've worked with other software such as Jupyter, FFmpeg, pandas, and other Python graphics/media manipulation libraries.

Academically and professionally, I am inclined towards research in Applied Mathematics and Dynamical Systems. 

On this page you can find research and academic projects, as well as some smaller, creatively-driven programs.
